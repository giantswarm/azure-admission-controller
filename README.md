# Azure Admission Controller

Giant Swarm Control Plane admission controller for Azure that implements the following rules:

- Check for TC upgrades to avoid skipping major or minor releases. 

The certificates for the webhook are created with CertManager and injected through the CA Injector.

### Local Development

Testing the azure-admission-controller in a kind cluster on your local machine:

```nohighlight
kind create cluster

# Build a linux image
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build .
docker build . -t azure-admission-controller:dev
kind load docker-image azure-admission-controller:dev

# Make sure the Custom Resource Definitions are in place
opsctl ensure crds -k "$(kind get kubeconfig)" -p azure

# Insert the certificate
kubectl apply --context kind-kind -f local_dev/certmanager.yml

## Wait until certmanager is up

kubectl apply --context kind-kind -f local_dev/clusterissuer.yml
helm template azure-admission-controller -f helm/azure-admission-controller/ci/default-values.yaml helm/azure-admission-controller > local_dev/deploy.yaml

## Replace image name with azure-admission-controller:dev
kubectl apply --context kind-kind -f local_dev/deploy.yaml
kind delete cluster
```
